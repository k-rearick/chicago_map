## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r mapsetup}
chicago_map <- read_sf(ward_boundaries.geojson)
ggplot(data = chicago+map) + geom_sf()
hbh_data <- read.csv("hbh_locations.csv")
hbh_df <- data.frame(hbh_data)
hbh_df$Lat <- as.numeric(hbh_df$Lat)
hbh_df$Long <- as.numeric(hbh_df$Long)
hbh_df$Site <- as.character(hbh_df$Site)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
